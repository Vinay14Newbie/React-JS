1)  Building context
-Create a folder name context
-call 'React.createContext()' and store it in a variable
-export that variable

2)  We have to make an provider to provide the data
wrap all components in this provider like this:

<UserContext.Provider>
    {children}
<UserContext.Provider/>

now it is a parovider
now UserContext is a global context and it has access of all the components

3)  
import context Provider
Wrap that components as follow..
<UserContextProvider>
      <Login/>
      <Profile/>
</UserContextProvider>

Now Login and Profile both components has the access from global context

4)
-in components when you want to use that hooks which are declared in Provider, first import 'UserContext' not 'Provider'
-import a hook 'useContext'
now you can access the global context by using simple code like this    
const User = useContext(UserContext) 
console.log(User); //{user: null, name: 'vinay', setUser: Æ’}
OR
const {user, setUser} = useContext(UserContext)
