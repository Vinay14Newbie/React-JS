inside the fragment </> all tags should be closing tags
Props make the components reusable
'rfce' short hand, it bring functional component (react snippet requires)

-As we receive props as an object and using this can increase our work
Ex. function Card(props){
        console.log(props.username);
    }
   so here we have to acces the value throught the object, so here object destructuring comes into picture, by writing it inside a {} we get short hand for that object
{} it's destructuring see this : '\Javascript\2_Basics\4_objects2_de-structuring.js'
As we know this is how the react parse the code...
const reactElement = {
    type: 'a', 
    props: {
        href: 'https://google.com',
        target: '_blank'
    },
    children: 'Click me to visit google'
}
So here, attributes receives as an object which is 'props' so use destructuring :)
