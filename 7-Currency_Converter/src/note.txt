useId()
useId is a React Hook for generating unique IDs that can be passed to accessibility attributes.
- Don't call useId to generate keys in a list



always use key when writing code in jsx file, without it performance will be dead  : remember the key in react
while using loop
{currencyOptions.map((currency)=>(
    <option key={currency} value={currency}>   
        {currency}
    </option>
))}



'onCurrencyChange' is undefined it will not be executed | as we know undefined is false
if 'onCurrencyChange' is defined then only call the 'onCurrencyChange' : && operator ensures `onCurrencyChange` is defined before calling it 
onChange={(e)=> onCurrencyChange && onCurrencyChange(e.target.value)}  // changing the currency in 'state' in App.jsx




const options = Object.keys(currencyInfo)   //value inside options are in array form
